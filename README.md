# Data-Science-Comp
In this competition, I was asked to analyze data on thousands of higher education institutions in the United States across 2013, 2014, 2015, and 2016 in order to make predictions about enrollment, retention, and graduation rates for hundreds of other universities. In short, I will have to create predictive models that will learn from complete training datasets on many US universities in order to predict responses for new inputs.

Each of the four training files contains 1491 of rows, each of which corresponds to a U.S. college or university in addition to a header row. The names of each institution have been removed. Depending on the year, each row contains between 29 to 32 different variables that explain something about the university or the state in which that university resides.
Once I have developed, trained, tested, validated, and improved the predictive model(s), I had run on trained models against this "new" Prediction dataset in order to estimate response variables related to: Enrollment, Retention, and Graduation Rates

My job is to fill in these missing variables for these new institutions using predictions derived from your predictive model.

I got the predicted values error of 1.23 rmse with this project
